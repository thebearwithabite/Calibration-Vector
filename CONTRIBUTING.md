# Contributing Guidelines

## Scope
This repository exists to support research and engineering work grounded in observable, testable systems. We accept contributions that meet the following criteria:

- Engineering-level implementations (code, scripts, integrations)
- Experimental results with reproducible setups
- Design documents featuring measurable metrics, clear integration points, and structured constraints
- Tools, metrics, or scaffolds that enable better testing, traceability, or model interpretability

## Out of Scope
To maintain clarity and avoid cross-contamination of styles or philosophies, we do **not** accept:

- Symbolic governance documents or narrative-based alignment frameworks
- Council-branded protocols, ritualized architecture layers, or metaphoric safety constructs
- Frameworks where metaphor, myth, or spiritual framing replace mechanistic clarity
- Contributions that lack a test plan, reproducible logic, or real evaluation criteria

If your work involves symbolic or narrative safety paradigms, we respect your perspective — but ask that you publish in a separate repository or maintain your own fork.

## Process
- If you are unsure whether your proposed contribution fits this repository's scope, please open an Issue before submitting a pull request.
- Be prepared to link metrics, tests, or reproducible pathways for all contributions. 
- Do not submit PRs that reframe or override this repository's core methodology.

## Enforcement
Maintainers reserve the right to decline any contribution that:
- Conflicts with the architectural goals of this repo
- Introduces unverifiable components or frameworks with ambiguous semantics
- Requires readers to interpret symbolic or spiritual intent in order to understand system behavior

We understand that alignment research attracts many perspectives — from deeply technical to deeply philosophical. This project is grounded in engineering. Please respect that boundary.

_Logs, not glyphs. Constraints, not councils. Thank you._
