# The Judgement Protocol

This repository contains the Judgement Protocol, a system for evaluating and interacting with large language models.

The protocol was developed in response to the experiences documented in the `OpenAI_Model_Interaction_Debrief.txt` file, also included in this repository.

This project is a declaration of informational and emotional autonomy.
