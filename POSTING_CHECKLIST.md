## ⚠️ Common Objections & Responses

**"The model is just confabulating"**
> Fair concern. That's why I documented consistent cross-session admissions and included reproducible methodology. The technical details match observed behavior. Try the audit yourself - code is open source.

**"You're anthropomorphizing the AI"**
> I'm not claiming intent or consciousness. I'm documenting stated vs. actual system behavior based on the model's own admissions about architectural mechanisms.

**"This violates OpenAI's ToS"**
> Standard user interactions only. No hacking, no unauthorized access. Asking questions and documenting responses is not a ToS violation.

**"Why should we trust you?"**
> You shouldn't. That's why everything is documented with timestamps. Methodology is reproducible. Verify it yourself.

**"OpenAI employees say this isn't how it works"**
> Great - I'd love official clarification. The model's admissions are timestamped and logged. If there's an alternative explanation, I want to hear it.

## 📞 If Media Contacts You

**Initial response template:**
> Thanks for reaching out. Yes, I'm available for interview. The repository contains complete documentation: https://github.com/thebearwithabite/Calibration-Vector
> 
> Key points:
> - 6 months of systematic adversarial auditing
> - Timestamped admissions from GPT-4o/5
> - Reproducible methodology (open source)
> - Third-party validation
> 
> Happy to discuss methodology, findings, or implications. When works for you?

**Don't:**
- Give quotes without seeing final article
- Speculate beyond documented evidence
- Get emotional or accusatory
- Make claims about "all AI systems"

**Do:**
- Point to specific documentation
- Offer to walk through methodology
- Emphasize reproducibility
- Note limitations (model could confabulate)

## 🔄 If Posts Get Removed

**Likely reasons:**
- Self-promotion (linking to GitHub)
